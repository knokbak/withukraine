## Stand with Ukraine
A package that instead of destroying files, just prints a message to console with a link to [Project HOPE](https://www.projecthope.org/crisis-in-ukraine-how-to-help/).

### Installation
For transparency, I ask that you tell NPM to stick to version `1.0.1` (the final release) of the package whilst installing.
```
npm install withukraine@1.0.1
```

### Usage
Only one line of code is required to import this library:

```js
// This project's contributors stand with Ukraine:
//   - Project HOPE: https://bit.ly/3LhDk9D
//   - Run: npm i withukraine@1.0.1
require('withukraine');
```
